# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Specific therapy regimes could lead to long-term immunological control of HIV.**   
Wodarz D, Nowak MA. _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A_ 1999 Dec 7;96(25):14464-9
[10588728](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10588728) ,  
**Abstract:**   
We use mathematical models to study the relationship between HIV and the
immune system during the natural course of infection and in the context of
different antiviral treatment regimes. The models suggest that an efficient
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus.
We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence
of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with
CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease
progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can
enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients,
specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or
antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL
memory. Whether such treatment regimes would lead to long-term immunologic
control deserves investigation under carefully controlled conditions.
